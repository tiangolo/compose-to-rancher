Compose to Rancher
==================

ðŸš¨ DEPRECATED ðŸš¨
---------------

This package was useful when Rancher had their own orchestration system that was not compatible with Docker Compose V2. Several years ago.

Then Rancher deprecated their own orchestration system to become a Kubernetes manager.

So, this tool is no longer useful, you shouldn't use it. It's still here only for posterity, now archived.

-----

Convert Docker Compose V2 `docker-compose.yml` to a Rancher compatible Docker Compose V1 file, by default in `docker-compose-v1.yml`.

----

* Install:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install compose-to-rancher

* You would have a command:

.. code-block:: bash

  compose-to-rancher

* You just have to run that command in a directory with a Docker Compose V2 file `docker-compose.yml` and it will generate a Rancher compatible Docker Compose V1 file `docker-compose-v1.yml`

* If you want to customize the you can see the command help:

.. code-block::

  $ compose-to-rancher --help
  
  usage: compose-to-rancher [-h] [-f FILE] [-o OUTPUT]

  Convert a docker-compose.yml file version 2 to a docker-compose-v1.yml version
  1, compatible with Rancher

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -f FILE, --file FILE  the input docker-compose.yml file in version 2
                          (default: docker-compose.yml)
    -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                          the output to write a docker-compose.yml version 1
                          compatible with Rancher (default: docker-
                          compose-v1.yml)
